# Compiling an eBPF Object File



1. eBPF source code needs to be compiled into the machine instructions that the eBPF virtual machine can understand.

2. The Clang compiler from the LLVM project will do this if you specify `--target bpf`
   ```makefile
   hello.bpf.o: %.o: %.c
   clang \
   -target bpf \
   -I/usr/include/$(shell uname -m)-linux-gnu \
   -g \
   -O2 -c $< -o $@
   ```

â€‹		this generates an object file called `hello.bpf.o` from source code.

## Inspecting an eBPF Object File

```bash
$ llvm-objdump-14 -S ./hello.bpf.o

./hello.bpf.o:	file format elf64-bpf
