2. **File system cache:** An area of main memory used to cache file system contents.
3. **Operations:** File system operations are requests of the file system, including read(2), write(2), open(2),close(2) and other operations.
4. **Logical I/O:** I/O issued by the application to the file system.
5. **Physical I/O:** I/O issued directly to disks by the file system (or via raw I/O)
6. **inode:** An index node (inode) is a data structure containing metadata for a file system object, including permissions, timestamps, and data pointers.
