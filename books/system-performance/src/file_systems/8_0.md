# File Systems

1. File system performance often matters more to the application than disk or storage device performance, because it is the file system that applications interact with and wait for.
2. File systems can use caching, buffering, and asynchronous I/O
3. System performance analysis and monitoring tools have historically focused on the disk performance, leaving file system performance as a blind stop.
