# Models

1. One approach for studying file system performance is to treat it as a black box, focusing on the latency of the object operations.

## File System Cache

1. file system cache stored in main memory.
2. The read returns data either cache(cache hit) or from disk(cache miss).
3. Cache miss are stored in the cache, populating the cache(warming up).
4. The file system cache may also buffer writes to be written (flushed) later.
5. Kernels often provide a way to bypass the cache if desired.

## Second-Level Cache

1. Second-level cache may be any memory type. RAM -> Flash Memory -> High Density Disks
