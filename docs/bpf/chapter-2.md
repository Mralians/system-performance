# Chapter 2

#### technology Background

------

1. **BPF** was originally developed for the **BSD** operation system.

2. **BPF** works in an interesting way: A filter expression is defined by the end user using an instruction set for a BPF virtual machine (sometimes called the BPF byte-code) and then passed to the kernel for execution by a interpreter.

3. (pros) this method allows filtering to occur in the kernel level without costly copies of each packet going to the user-level processes.(improving performance)

4. (pros) it also provide safety, as filters from user space can be verified as being safe before execution.

5. Extended BPF(**eBPF**) added more registers, switched from 32-bit to 64-bit words, created flexible BPF "map" storage, and allowed calls to some restricted kernel functions. it was also designed to be be JITed with a one-to-one mapping instructions and registers, allowing prior native instruction optimization techniques to be reused for BPF. the BPF verifier was also updated to handle these extensions and reject any unsafe code.

6. **BPF** programs can execute custom latency calculations and statistical  summaries.

7. what makes **BPF** different is that it is also efficient and production environments withouts needing to add any new kernel components!.

   ```bash
   bitehist #shows the size of disk I/O as a histogram
   ```

8. **BPF** can be programmed via one of the many front end available. The main ones for tracing are,from lowest-to-highest-level language.

   - LLVM IR
   - BCC
   - bpftrace

9. bpftool(8) was added in linux 4.15 for viewing and manipulation BPF objects,including programs and maps.

10. the `bpftool perf` subcommand shows BPF programs attached via `perf_event_open()`,witch is the norm for BCC and bpftrace programs on linux 4.17 and later.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install binutils-dev
    sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
    cd <linux-source-directory>/tools/bpf/
    make
    bpftool prog dump xlated id 263 visual > biolatency_done.dot #graphViz
    dot -Tpng -Elen=2.5 biolatency_done.dot -o biolatency_done.png
    ```

11. The `prog dump jited` subcommand shows the machine code for the processor that is executed.

12. The `btf dump id <id-number>` shows the BTF IDs.

13. A **BPF** program cannot call arbitrary kernel functions. to accomplish certain tasks with this limitation, "helper" functions that BPF can call have been provided.

    â€‹																		**BPF Helper functions**

    | BPF Helper Function                                | Description                                                  |
    | :------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `bpf_map_lookup_elem(map, key)`                    | **Finds** a key in a map and returns its value(pointer).     |
    | `bpf_map_update_elem(map,key,value,flags)`         | **Update** the value of the entry selected by key.           |
    | `bpf_map_delete_elem(map, key)`                    | **Deletes** the entry selected by key from the map.          |
    | `bpf_probe_read(dst, size, src)`                   | Safely reads size bytes from address src n and stores in dst. |
    | `bpf_ktime_get_ns()`                               | Returns the time since boot,in nanoseconds.                  |
    | `bpf_trace_printk(fmt, fmt_size, ...)`             | A debugging helper that writes to TraceFs trace{_pipe}.      |
    | `bpf_get_current_pid_tgid()`                       | Returns a u64 containing the current TGID (what user space calls the PID) in the upper bits and current PID (what user space calls the kernel thread ID) in the lower bits. |
    | `bpf_perf_event_output(ctx, map, data, size)`      | Writes data to the perf_event ring buffers; this is used for per-event output. |
    | `bpf_get_stackid(ctx, map, flags)`                 | Fetches a user or kernel stack trace and returns an identifier. |
    | `bpf_get_current_task()`                           | Returns the current task struct. this contains many details about the running process and links to other structs containing system state. Note that these are all considered an unstable API. |
    | `pbf_probe_read_str(dst, size, ptr)`               | Copies a NULL terminated string from an unsafe pointer to the destination, limited by size (including the NULL byte). |
    | `bpf_perf_event_read_value(map, flags, buf, size)` | Reads a perf_event counter and stores it in the buf. This is a way to read PMCs during a BPF program. |
    | `bpf_get_current_cgroup_id()`                      | Returns the current cgroup ID.                               |
    | `bpf_spin_lock(lock)`<br />`bpf_spin_unlock(lock)` | Concurrency control for network programs.                    |
    | `bpf_current_comm(buf, buf_size)`                  | Copies the task name to the buffer.                          |

14. The term current in these descriptions refers to the currently running thread. the thread that is currently on-CPU.

15. `include/uapi/linux/bpf.h` file often provides detailed documentation for these helpers.

16. `bpf_probe_read()` is a particularly important helper. Memory access in BPF is restricted to BPF registers and the stack. Arbitrary memory(such as other kernel memory outside of BPF) must be read via `pbf_probe_read()`, witch performs safety checks and disables page faults to ensure that the reads do not cause faults from probe context (witch could cause kernel problems).
