Linux Security Modules (LSMs) and Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) are both security features in Linux, but they serve different purposes. LSMs focus on controlling access to kernel objects like files and interprocess communication structures through Mandatory Access Control. This control is typically managed by a security administrator and not easily changed by unprivileged users.

Seccomp, initially proposed in 2004, limits the system calls a process can make. It started as a strict mode allowing only basic system calls but evolved to include a filter mode in 2012, where processes can define their own system call filtering policy using Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) bytecode. This mode allows processes to prevent any system calls, including their descendants, enhancing security by reducing the kernel's attack surface.

However, seccomp cannot model the same policies as LSMs. For instance, it can't prevent processes from accessing specific filesystem locations due to its inability to dereference pointers. Once a filter is attached to a process, it can't be removed or modified, making global policy application challenging. Seccomp filters are typically managed by application developers, who are more aware of the necessary system calls for their applications.

In conclusion, while LSMs are better for creating a detailed security policy across the system, seccomp is more suited for allowing unprivileged processes to limit their system calls, playing a key role in process sandboxing techniques like Linux containers. Both tools are not designed to prevent hacks but to limit an attacker's ability to exploit a flaw in one program to affect other areas of the system.
